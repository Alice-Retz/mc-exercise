* How could these problems have been prevented?

1. First pair program scenario a conflict arose because Bob and carol didn't pull a git origin main.

1. Merging files can be resolved sometimes in GitHub or in VScode/ Can git pull origin main to see the new conflicting data. 

1. Creating branches allows to preview changes before they are added to main instead of a team just operating off pushing and pulling off a main all together.
